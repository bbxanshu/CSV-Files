Epic	Feature	User Story	Tasks	Acceptance Criteria
Automated Process Monitoring Agent	Requirement Analysis	As a Product Owner, I want the agent to parse and understand requirements, so I can ensure they are complete.	"1. Implement NLP capabilities to extract key elements from requirements.
2. Integrate with project management tools (e.g., Jira)."	"- Agent can extract requirements and identify key elements like objectives and constraints.
- Requirements can be updated dynamically."
Automated Process Monitoring Agent		As a Developer, I want the agent to suggest clarifications for ambiguous requirements.	"1. Build ambiguity detection rules.
2. Design a feedback mechanism for requirement clarifications."	"- Agent flags unclear requirements and provides suggestions for clarification.
- Product Owner receives actionable feedback."
Automated Process Monitoring Agent	Code Quality Assessment	As a Developer, I want the agent to analyze code quality, so I can ensure it adheres to standards.	"1. Integrate static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube).
2. Create a rule engine for custom coding standards."	"- Code quality reports are generated with actionable insights.
- Coding standard violations are identified and logged."
Automated Process Monitoring Agent		As a Scrum Master, I want the agent to monitor code reviews, so I can track progress and compliance.	"1. Link the agent to code review tools (e.g., GitHub).
2. Track pull requests and code review outcomes."	"- The agent provides reports on review status and highlights pending reviews.
- PR comments are categorized by severity."
Automated Process Monitoring Agent	Completion Validation	As a Tester, I want the agent to validate test cases, so I can ensure they are comprehensive.	"1. Integrate with CI/CD tools for test automation.
2. Create a test case coverage analyzer."	"- Test coverage is reported as a percentage.
- Missing edge cases are identified automatically."
Automated Process Monitoring Agent		As a Product Owner, I want the agent to verify the Definition of Done, so I can confirm task completion.	"1. Develop a checklist for DoD validation.
2. Build automated approval workflows for the DoD."	"- All DoD criteria are tracked and marked complete before a task is marked as done.
- Notifications are sent for incomplete DoD items."
Automated Process Monitoring Agent	Testing Automation	As a QA Engineer, I want the agent to automate regression testing, so I can save time.	"1. Create test scripts for recurring tests.
2. Automate execution in CI/CD pipelines."	"- Regression tests are executed automatically after every commit.
- Failures are logged with detailed reports."
Automated Process Monitoring Agent	Coordination Agent	As a Team Lead, I want the agent to consolidate data from all features, so I can view progress at a glance.	"1. Design a dashboard to display key metrics.
2. Build APIs to pull data from all other agents."	"- The dashboard shows real-time data across all features.
- Reports can be exported in multiple formats."
Task Completeness Monitoring	Unified Task Validation System	As a Scrum Master, I want the agent to validate a task’s end-to-end completeness across all stages, so I can ensure it meets expectations.	"1. Design a workflow that integrates all agents for task validation.
2. Set up inter-agent communication protocols for seamless data sharing.
3. Define validation checkpoints for each step (Developer, Tester, Product Owner, Customer)."	"- Agent validates tasks against defined checkpoints.
- Notifications are sent for incomplete or inconsistent tasks.
- A consolidated task completion report is generated."
Task Completeness Monitoring	Metrics Dashboard	As a Product Owner, I want the agent to display key metrics, so I can measure completeness, accuracy, and quality.	"1. Identify relevant metrics (e.g., code quality score, test coverage, DoD compliance rate).
2. Create visualizations (e.g., bar charts, pie charts) for tracking metrics.
3. Develop real-time update capability for metrics on the dashboard."	"- Dashboard displays real-time metrics.
- Metrics can be filtered by stage (Developer, Tester, Product Owner, Customer).
- Metric trends over time are available for analysis."
Task Completeness Monitoring	Completeness Metrics Definition	As a Team Lead, I want to establish clear metrics for completeness, so the team’s progress can be objectively measured.	"1. Define metrics:
- Completeness: % of tasks meeting all DoD criteria.
- Accuracy: % of tasks with successful test cases.
- Quality: Code quality score from static analysis tools.
2. Automate metric collection and calculation.
3. Integrate metrics into daily standup reports."	"- Metrics are consistently calculated and displayed.
- Completeness, accuracy, and quality are tracked at task, feature, and sprint levels.
- Alerts are triggered for metrics below threshold values."
Task Completeness Monitoring	Multi-Agent Checkpoint Validation	As a Developer, I want agents to validate specific checkpoints in the workflow, so I can fix issues early.	"1. Define checkpoints for each agent:
- Requirement Agent: Validates requirement clarity.
- Code Quality Agent: Confirms coding standards.
- Testing Agent: Validates test case success.
- Validation Agent: Confirms DoD criteria.
2. Develop inter-agent communication APIs.
3. Create feedback mechanisms for checkpoint failures."	"- Each checkpoint is validated by its respective agent.
- Feedback is provided within 5 minutes of validation.
- Developers can see a detailed report for failed checkpoints."
Task Completeness Monitoring	End-to-End Workflow Reporting	As a Scrum Master, I want a consolidated report for task completeness, so I can track progress across the team.	"1. Consolidate data from all agents.
2. Create a report template with metrics for each task.
3. Automate weekly report generation and distribution."	"- Reports are generated and distributed automatically.
- Each task’s completeness, accuracy, and quality metrics are included.
- Reports highlight areas for improvement."
